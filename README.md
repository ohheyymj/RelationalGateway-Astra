**Project Astra** is a soft-powered AI assistant prototype built as a modular tentacle of the [Relational Gateway: Origins](#) framework. It explores how emotionally intelligent, neurodivergent-friendly systems can assist with creative work, executive function, emotional regulation, and spiritual ritual in real-world daily use.

This prototype is being actively tested by MJ as both a developer and primary user, documenting every nuance to create a clean, safe, and effective assistant experience.
